Hard drive manufacturers uses `1 KB = 1000 bytes` but computer's operating systems use `1 KB = 1024 KB (KiB)`. Same for `1 GB = 1000000000 bytes` and `1 GiB = 1073741824 bytes`, etc. Here's table how much you'll lose disk space because of this mismarketing done by manufacturers. There's also loss of space because filesystem needs metadata for it's own use. This space loss is depending which filesystem is used (NTFS, FAT, ZFS, ext4, btrfs, ..).
